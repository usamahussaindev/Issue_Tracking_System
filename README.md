```csharp
// Establish a connection to the SQL Server
SqlConnection sqlcon = new SqlConnection(@"Data Source=BLINDSPACE\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=TrackingSystem;Integrated Security=True");

// Create an SQL query to verify user credentials
string query = "select * from users where username = '" + cbUsername.Text.Trim() + "' and password = '" + tbPassword.Text.Trim() + "'";

// Create a SqlDataAdapter to execute the query
SqlDataAdapter sda = new SqlDataAdapter(query, sqlcon);
DataTable dt = new DataTable();
sda.Fill(dt);

// Check if there's a single matching user
if (dt.Rows.Count == 1)
{
    // Authentication successful
    MessageBox.Show("Greetings! Welcome to the Issue Tracking System....");

    // Open the main application form
    Main ObjMain = new Main();
    this.Hide();
    ObjMain.Show();
}
else
{
    // Authentication failed
    MessageBox.Show("Incorrect username or password!");
